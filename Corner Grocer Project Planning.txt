Corner Grocer Project Planning

Menu 1 <probably going to be the most annoying part>
Prompt user to input item they want to look for
Return numeric value for item frequency
	Only thing that can accept user input. Need to add a catch for when they input something bad or invalid

Menu2 -> a for loop but more annoying
Print the list with numbers representing frequency of all items purchased.
	Loop through the file then add them to an array, loop through the array to record the amount of the item purchased.



Menu 3 -> just a for loop
Print the same frequency information for all items in the form of a histogram.
Print name with a special character denoting the amount of times the item was purchased.
	Easy for loop using similar code to menu item 2


Menu 4
Exit the program.
